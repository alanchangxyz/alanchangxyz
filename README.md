## 🍊 hello! you've arrived at [@alanchangxyz](https://github.com/alanchangxyz)

👋 I'm Alan Chang,
- 💻 a senior studying computer science at UC Irvine,
- 🌉 a San Francisco Bay Area native,
- 🍝 and an enjoyer of the best pastas around.

I'm passionate about solving both the big and the little problems in life and I'm always up for a fun challenge! 

## 🌺 previously...
I interned at Amazon in Summer 2022 and 2023, where I built DevOps monitoring for a new page architecture for AWS Cost Explorer and prototyped a fullstack tool for building new page configurations!

I was also one of two Technical Directors at **[Commit the Change](https://github.com/ctc-uci)**, a student organization empowering Southern California nonprofits with customized pro bono software solutions to address their needs. I contributed extensively to the club's technical planning and implementation processes, and created partnerships with nonprofits that continue to generate impact in the present day!

## 🚀 currently...
I'm looking for new grad SWE roles while finishing up my bachelor's degree at UC Irvine to graduate in Spring 2024!

I'm also behind the scenes year-round at UC Irvine's hackathons as part of **[Hack at UCI](https://hack.ics.uci.edu)**, in the forms of **[ZotHacks](https://zothacks.com)**, **[Hack@UCI](https://hackuci.com)**, and **[VenusHacks](https://venushacks.com)**.
