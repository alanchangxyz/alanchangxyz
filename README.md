## 🍊 hello! you've arrived at [@alanchangxyz](https://github.com/alanchangxyz)

👋 I'm Alan Chang,
- 💻 a software engineer currently in Seattle,
- 🌉 a San Francisco Bay Area native,
- 🍝 and an enjoyer of the best pastas around.

I'm always looking for ways to improve things, no matter how big or small! I spend lots of time focusing on better processes to build better products with less time and effort.

## 🌺 previously...

I obtained my degree in computer science this past year from the University of California, Irvine!

As an advisor and organizer at [Hack at UCI](https://hack.ics.uci.edu), I spearheaded initiatives behind the scenes of Orange County's largest collegiate hackathons to leverage growth opportunities, mentor new organizers, and increase hacker & sponsor engagement. I also advised for [ZotHacks](https://zothacks.com) and [VenusHacks](https://venushacks.com), events which catered towards first-time and underrepresented hackathon participants.

As a member of the inaugural cohort and through multiple leadership roles at [Commit the Change](https://github.com/ctc-uci), I worked extensively with Southern California nonprofits to generate social impact by addressing organizational needs and eliminating procedural bottlenecks through customized, pro bono software partnerships. I contributed to nine different nonprofit projects, and implemented and standardized processes for outreach, internal planning, and technical development which continue to be used today!
